                    Sudha is born in Tamil family in 1964. Mr. K. D. Chandran and Mrs. Thangam are her father and
                    mother.
                    She had done her schooling in Mumbai and is a post graduate holder in Economics. She started her
                    dance
                    education in Kala Sadan, Mumbai, at the age of 5 and managed both her study and dance aswell. When
                    she
                    was 17, she has completed 75 stage performances. She has received two important awards ' Nritya
                    Mayuri
                    from the Dance Academy and Bharatnatyam and Nav Jyoti from the Telugu Academy . Both these awards
                    were
                    received prior to the accident and considered outstanding in the field of dance.

                    The tragedy hit her on May 2, 1981 in the form of a bus accident while she was travelling with her
                    parents to a temple in Tamilnadu. In the accident, her right leg was severely injured and the doctor
                    who
                    attended her made a mistake which led to the amputation of her right leg, 71/2 inches below the
                    knee.

                    Unfortunately, while treatment was going on her leg, doctors missed a small wound in her ankle and
                    plastered it! Later she came to know that the the gangrene is spreading throughout the leg. Whenever
                    gangrene develops in the body, the body part has to be amputated to save the person’s life. Hence
                    the
                    difficult decision at this point she and her parents had taken is “amputate the leg”. Sudha’s leg
                    was
                    amputated in order to save her life.<br>

                    Here amputate means to surgically remove a limb for medical reasons.

                    She was not willing to confined to a wheel chair even after the amputation of her and she made all
                    the
                    possible efforts to walk. After six months since the amputation, Sudha read in a magazine about Dr.
                    Sethi, a specialist in artificial limbs and recipient of the Raman Magasassay Award, from Jaipur.
                    Sudha
                    wrote to him. Meanwhile her family visited a company in the Opera House in Mumbai where they saw
                    this
                    artificial leg (Jaipur foot) in a showcase. Her confidence and desire for dance was again revived.
                    Dr.
                    Sethi made all the possible efforts to make an artificial foot according to her dancing requirement.

                    star
                    over night. The famous producer Ramoji Rao, not only praised her but also decided to produce a film
                    based on her life story. The film was titled as Mayuri, a Telugu film, and released in 1984. Sudha
                    won a
                    special award-Silver Lotus and Rs.5,000 for her acting in this film. This award was presented by the

                    In 1986, on seeing the outstanding success of the film, Ramoji Rao re-made the film in Hindi and
                    named
                    as Nache Mayuri, where she played the lead role. With its release, Sudha became known to people in
                    India
                    as well as abroad and she proved that she is not only a dancer but an actress too On 4 September,
